## File Upload

cat path/to/file | encrypt | curl --data-binary @- \
 https://baxx.dev/io/$BAXX_TOKEN/path/to/file

or (no encryption, strongly discouraged)
curl -T path/to/file https://baxx.dev/io/$BAXX_TOKEN/path/to/file

Query Parameters:
  keep_n: how many versions you want of this file
  age: notify if there is no new version in N sec (0 means disable)
  delta: notify if the new version is n% different (0 means disable)

Example:
  cat f | encrypt | curl --data-binary @- \
   "https://baxx.dev/io/$BAXX_TOKEN/f?keep_n=10&age=3600&delta=10"
  
  It will keep 10 versions of the file, when you upload 11th version
  it will delete the first one.
  
  If no new file for path 'f' is sent within 1 hour, or the new file
  is 10% too different, you will receive notification

to change the settings you can upload new file with
  cat f | encrypt | curl --data-binary @- \
   "https://baxx.dev/io/$BAXX_TOKEN/f?keep_n=1&age=3600&delta=0"

You will receive only 1 notification per file version per file.
Meaning that if you receive an email that a file is too old,
until new version is uploaded you wont receive more notifications
for this file.
