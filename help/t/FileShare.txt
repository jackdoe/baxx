## File Share

It is possible to generate sharable uuid for any file.
The sharing is read only, but accessible from the whole internet, so
be careful.

To *share*:
 curl -XPOST https://baxx.dev/share/$BAXX_TOKEN/path/to/file

It will return a json object having a link you can use to download the
file, the format is: https://baxx/dev/s/:uuid
{
    "link": "https://baxx.dev/s/ffd34b6f-3d14-46ba-b3c1-7527f9a7cb3a",
    "uuid": "ffd34b6f-3d14-46ba-b3c1-7527f9a7cb3a"
}

If you run the share command again, it will generate a new link, and
the old one will be invalid

To *unshare*:
 curl -XPOST https://baxx.dev/unshare/$BAXX_TOKEN/path/to/file

To download shared file:
 curl https://baxx.dev/s/:uuid

To list all shared files:
 curl https://baxx.dev/ls/$BAXX_TOKEN/ | grep 'SHARE:'

Last column in /ls/$BAXX_TOKEN/ is SHARE:uuid.
